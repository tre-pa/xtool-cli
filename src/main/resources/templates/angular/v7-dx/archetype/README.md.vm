# DxAppTemplate

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.0.

## Add new view

Run `npx ng g devextreme-schematics:add-view --name=view/{name} --icon={icon} --module=view/view-routing` to create a View into the ViewModule. Go to the navigation in `/src/app/app.navigation.ts` and edit the view's path, removing the `view` prefix. Also do that to the view's route in the routes array, located in the `/src/app/view/view-routing.module.ts`, and make sure to move the view's route up. It shoud be a ViewPageComponent child.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
